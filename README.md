# cs310-queues-stacks-hash-tables

By the end of this project, you will have defined a stack class, a simple linear probing hash table, and a postfix computer.
You will use file I/O to read programs from files and execute them on your “computer”. If you’re unfamiliar with postfix
notation, the following programs (and their more familiar infix versions) are shown below:

Postfix:  3 2 +    
Equivalent Infix:  3 + 2     
This program takes 3 and 2, then adds them.

Postfix:  x 3 2 + = x  print       
Equivalent Infix:   x = 3 + 2 
                    print x

This program adds 3 and 2, then stores it in a
variable called x. Later. it is asked to print x.
